## Introduction

I’m only an average `pandoc` user. This site isn’t affiliated in or way with [the software](https://pandoc.org) or [its leading developer](http://johnmacfarlane.net/). Follow the links before to get information about them.

What I’m trying to elaborate in this pages is which improvements would make `pandoc` and _Markdown_ reasonably better.

The contents on this site are work in progress.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ousia/pandoc-improvements/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
